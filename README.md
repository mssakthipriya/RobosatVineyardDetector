# RobosatVineyardDetector
Data Preparation
	Collect satellite imagery or aerial photographs covering the target vineyard areas.
 
Data Preprocessing
	Convert the imagery to a suitable format compatible with RoboSat.
Dataset Creation
	Prepare a training dataset by combining the preprocessed imagery with annotations.
	Divide the dataset into training and validation subsets for model development and evaluation.
Model Training
	Utilize RoboSat's training capabilities to train a deep learning model for vineyard detection.
Model Evaluation
	Assess the trained model's performance by evaluating it on the validation dataset.
	Utilize RoboSat's object detection or semantic segmentation capabilities to identify vineyards within the imagery.
Post-processing
	Smooth boundaries, remove false positives, and improve the overall accuracy of the vineyard detection results.
Visualization and Analysis
	Visualize the detected vineyard areas on maps or imagery for further analysis.
Result Interpretation and Application
	Apply the findings to create your desired application
